# API Design

Document the endpoints you expose or consume.

## Endpoints
| Method | Path | Purpose | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /api/example | Brief description | Optional |

## Error Handling
How do you return errors? What should clients expect?

## Future Improvements
Ideas for versioning, pagination, or performance.
